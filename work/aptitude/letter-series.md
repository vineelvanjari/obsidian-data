📖 PAGE 2 – LETTER SERIES MASTER FILE 🔡🔥

This is your Loki-level mind manipulation chapter 🧠✨

Letter Series questions test pattern recognition 🔍 and positional logic.

There are 3 Major Types:


---

🔡 TYPE 1 – POSITION BASED SERIES

👉 Based on alphabetical positions.

A = 1
B = 2
C = 3
…
Z = 26

Core Formula:

Position of letter = Alphabet number

Forward Movement ➡️
New Position = Old Position + n

Backward Movement ⬅️
New Position = Old Position – n

Reverse Trick 🔄
Reverse Position = 27 – Original Position

Example:
Position of D = 4
Reverse = 27 – 4 = 23 = W


---

🔡 TYPE 2 – SKIP / GAP PATTERN

Pattern jumps with equal gaps.

Example:
A, C, F, J, O

Positions:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15

Difference:
+2, +3, +4, +5

Pattern: Increasing gap

General Rule:

Check differences between positions.
If differences increase → look for arithmetic progression in gaps.


---

🔡 TYPE 3 – ALTERNATE / DUAL SERIES

Two patterns running parallel 🔥

Example:
A, Z, B, Y, C, X

Pattern 1:
A, B, C → forward

Pattern 2:
Z, Y, X → backward

🔡 Special Letter Tricks

📌 Opposite Letter Formula
Opposite = 27 – position

📌 Middle Letter Formula
If sum of positions of first & last = 27 → they are opposites

📌 Word Value Formula
Word Value = Sum of letter positions

Example:
CAT
C = 3
A = 1
T = 20
Total = 24

🔥 Advanced Pattern Possibilities

✔️ Increasing jumps
✔️ Prime number jumps
✔️ Square number jumps
✔️ Fibonacci jumps
✔️ Reverse + forward mix
✔️ Position × 2 pattern
✔️ Position – 1 pattern

🧠 How to Attack Letter Series (Battle Strategy ⚔️)

Step 1️⃣ Convert letters to numbers
Step 2️⃣ Check differences
Step 3️⃣ Look for pattern
Step 4️⃣ Reconvert to letter

Never guess blindly 🚫

🛡️ Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting Z loop (after 26 comes 1)
❌ Ignoring alternate pattern
❌ Not checking reverse logic
❌ Missing position symmetry

If Aptitude is the Avengers Universe 🛡️

Arithmetic = Iron Man (technology + calculation)
Reasoning = Doctor Strange (mind bending patterns)
Data Interpretation = Nick Fury (strategy + control)

And Letter Series?

That’s Loki 😈 — illusion master.
