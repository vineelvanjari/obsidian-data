You wrote 5 Models.
Let’s formalize them properly.
🔐 CODING–DECODING MASTER TYPES
1️⃣ Letter Coding
Each letter replaced by another letter.
Formula:
New position = Old position ± n
Example logic:
DEF → UVW
D(4) → U(21)
Shift = +17
Uniform shift pattern
2️⃣ Number Coding
ABC → 1 2 3
Letter position directly written
Formula:
Letter → Position
3️⃣ Substitution Coding
Words replaced with other words
White → Blue
Blood → Yellow
No formula.
Logic depends on mapping from statements.
4️⃣ Mixed Letter Coding
Some letters change by shift
Some by reverse
Use 27 – position if reverse used
5️⃣ Mixed Number Coding
Words replaced by numbers
Example logic:
3 6 9 → nice sunday morning
If Sunday = 3
Evening = 2
Find common mapping across statements
Method:
Step 1️⃣ Identify common word
Step 2️⃣ Identify common number
Step 3️⃣ Map them
